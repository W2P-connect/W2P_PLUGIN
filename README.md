During synchronization, the plugin transmits order details, customer information, and product data through a secure API. This ensures that your sales data is accurately and efficiently integrated into Pipedrive.

All data transmissions follow industry-standard security protocols to protect user information. No personal data is stored on intermediary servers beyond the time required to process the request.

= Changelog ==

**= 1.1.1 - 2025-02-20 =**  

- Removed Pipedrive response from the query in your website database to prevent data leaks. Only the Pipedrive ID is retained.

- Fixed an issue where only one page of orders was displayed.

**= 1.1.0 - 2025-02-20 =**  

- Manual synchronization now also triggers the synchronization of the **Person** and **Organization** in Pipedrive (via the `user_updated` hook), ensuring that the Deal is correctly linked to the Person.
